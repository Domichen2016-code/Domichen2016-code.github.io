  <h1>This is my first website.I just joined github and just finished 
    swift playgrounds.
    This is what I learned:
    let can change but var could not
    learning how to write code and change letter size
    blu.jump makes blu jump expert.turn lock up makes expert turn the 
    lock up you can also turn the teleporter on and off you can make 
    things repeat by setting functions moving repeats by setting loops
    byte.collect gem the reddest gem you also turn switches on and off 
    if functions with else 
    This is the story:
    let can change but var can not blu.jump expert turn lock up they got 
    tired and so did i byte go foward and collect gem turn left and toggle
    switch i got tired but so happy i need a break/(i am tired)
    also lets set images and sounds
    This is the funny story
    row trust you and vivi lock you up and toggle switch and gem
    expert so tired resting while blu jumbs on him byte goes through 
    function goes on and loops up turn switch and telepotion goes so 
    hzppy yay by by thanks for reading
