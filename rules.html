  <h1>This is the Rules to each game</h1>
  
    <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
    <p>2 players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with X and O respectively. 
    The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game is a draw.</p>
    <h2>Guess the Number</h2>
    <p>The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100). After each guess, the computer provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.</p>
    <h2>Ghost Catcher</h2>
    <p>In this game, you have to try and click the ghost as many times as possible before the time runs out.</p>
    <h2>Battleship</h2>
    <p>In this game, AI automatically generates ships for you to sink. You must guess the locations of the ships on a grid and sink them before your chances run out.</p>
    <h2>Rock-Paper-Scissors</h2>
    <p>Two players choose one of three options with their keyboard: rock, paper, or scissors. For player 1, the keys are Q for rock, W for paper, and E for scissors. For player 2, the keys are I for rock, O for paper, and P for scissors. 
    The winner is determined by the following rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. If both players choose the same option, the game is a tie.</p>
